## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content such as text, images, audio, and video.  
These models are trained on vast datasets and learn to identify patterns, structures, and relationships within the data.  

By leveraging techniques such as deep learning and neural networks, generative AI can produce content that is often indistinguishable from human-created output.  

Applications include:
- Language Models (e.g., GPT)  
- Image Generators (e.g., DALL·E)  
- Music Composers

Generative AI is focused on creating new content by learning patterns from existing data.  

Core Concepts:
- Unsupervised Learning  
- Probabilistic Models  
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
- Generative Architectures:
  - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
  - VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)
  - Autoregressive Models  

These techniques enable the creation of realistic and high-quality outputs.

One of the most impactful advancements in Generative AI is the Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper *“Attention is All You Need”*.  

Key features:
- Uses self-attention instead of sequential processing  
- Handles context more effectively  
- Highly scalable and parallelizable  

Notable Transformer-based Models:
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)  
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
